# clickygame

# Overview
For this assignment, you'll create a memory game with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

# Deployment
* GitHub Pages Link
* GitHub Repository

# Technologies Utilized
* React
* JavaScript/ES6
* JSX
* Yarn dependencies mgmt
* Node dependencies
* Bootstrap 4
* CSS3
* Google Fonts
* heroku
* VSCode

# Instructions
* Create a new React application using Create React App.
* The application should render different images (of your choice) to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.
* The application should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
* Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.
* Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
* When complete, the application should be deployed to Github Pages. See the README generated with Create React App for instructions on deploying the application to Github Pages.
